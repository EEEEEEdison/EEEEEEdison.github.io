This is Edison, a Junior <strong>Data Scientist/Analyst</strong>.
 Here, I'll be showing some of my skills and experience in handling data.

You'll find examples on some of the works I've done under the "PROJECTS" page, such as 
database management, data visualization, and different machine learning projects.

But this website isn't just about work. I also want to share my personal interests and life story with you. You'll get to know the real me beyond the charts and graphs. <br /><br />


Thanks for stopping by, cheers! <br />

          <h1>Work Journey</h1>
          <br />

          <p>
            My work journey began during my first year at university when I took up part-time tutoring. I thoroughly enjoyed sharing knowledge with high school students in subjects like Mathematics and IELTS (an English exam for foreign students). <br /> <br />

            During my second year, I had the opportunity to participate in a work-study program at <a href = "https://uwaterloo.ca/campus-wellness/health-services/family-health-clinic" target="_blank">UW Health Services</a>. <br />
            Here, I honed my skills in Excel and office administration while ensuring a smooth patient flow, ensuring that incoming patients receive the best possible treatments and experience reduced waiting times.  <br /> <br />

            Seeking to pursue my personal interest in automotive mechanics, I joined a car dealership as an auto apprentice during a summer break.  <br /> <br />

            After graduating from university, I embraced a full-time career as a Parts Advisor at <a href="https://www.schlueteracura.com/" target="_blank">Acura</a>. My role involved managing the dealership's parts inventory and handling both retail and wholesale transactions. I took pride in ensuring a flawless local supply chain for Acura parts, delivering prompt and reliable service to customers. <br /> <br /> 

            After two enjoyable years at Acura, personal circumstances led me to relocate to BC. During this time, I seized the opportunity to become a Business Analyst at <a href="https://sightlinetech.com/" target="_blank">Sightline Technology</a>. Utilizing my proficiency in Quickbooks, Excel, and PowerBi, I presented insights and ideas including precision inventory control, using compelling graphs and data. <br /> <br />

            This year, I undertook a co-op Software Developer position at <a href = "https://research.conestogac.on.ca/smart-centre" target="_blank">Conestoga Smart Centre</a>, a research facility partnering with diverse industries to develop smart business solutions. As a part of an exceptional team, we designed a web AI application to assist poultry farmers in reducing costs and automating operation processes. <br /> <br />

            My career journey has nurtured me with a diverse skill set and passion. I am eager to embrace new challenges and contribute my expertise to making a positive impact where my path leads next.

          <h1>Automotives</h1>
          <p>
            I found my knack for working with vehicles at a young age, starting with a simple air intake modification. <br />
            Over time, I moved on to rebuilding chassis and tinkering with engine parts. Fixing cars is a lot like data analysis <br />
            â€”identifying the problem and using the right tools to solve it.  <br />
